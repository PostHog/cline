# Without this patch, the extension cannot load `node-sqlite3`'s `node_sqlite3.node` binary, and fails to init altogether.
#
# This is a rabbit hole:
#
# `node-sqlite3` uses `node-bindings` to load the binary. To identify in what directory to look for the binary,
# `node-bindings` tries to the location of the current script being executed (`getRoot()` and `getFileName()`).
# It does so by extracting the current stack trace via a dummy error. The depth of that stack trace is limited
# to 10 items.
#
# HOWEVER, `getFileName()` in its resolution skips the script where `getFileName()` _itself_ is located
# (Node global var `__filename`). This is a problem in a bundled VS Code extension â€“ our `extension.js`
# is only loaded by the VS Code extension host. The first non-`extension.js` item in the stack trace ends up being
# `node:internal/modules/cjs/loader` at the 8th position. That is not an actual filesystem path, which means the
# sqlite3 binary fails to load!
#
# We fix the issue by limiting the stack trace depth to 1, which means our `extension.js` is correctly resolved.
# In a more complex extension, we would also have silently bypassed this is if our stack trace _within_ `extension.js`
# was deeper than 10 items. Perhaps this is why this is not a commonplace issue in extensions using `node-sqlite3`.
